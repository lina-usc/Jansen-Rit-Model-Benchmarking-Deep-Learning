# Jansen-Rit-Model-Benchmarking-Deep-Learning
Code repository for the Benchmarking Deep Jansen-Rit Parameter Inference: An in Silico Study


Model-driven effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various stimuli. This approach involves estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity, and it can be deployed for various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining these connections remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in recordings of neural activity, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by comprehensive whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we present a simulation module based on the well-known Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) and benchmark it under various noise conditions. We consider simulated recordings with noise levels ranging from none to levels typical of real EEG recordings and simulate 1000 recordings per noise condition. We then benchmark the performance of a Bi-LSTM model to infer JR-NMM parameters from EEG amidst different noise levels. Our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in critical factors like synaptic gains and time constants. Investigating how such biological parameters impact the neural recordings generated by such models is crucial in understanding the connection between brain activity and behavior. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of this approach. In the future, we will extend this inference approach to estimating local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications, such as autism spectrum disorder.

# Description

This repository includes three Jupyter notebooks designed for dataset simulation, sensitivity analysis, and deep learning analysis of ERP (Event-Related Potentials) parameters:

    1) DCM_for_JR_all_varied_11_May.ipynb generates datasets by simulating X (ERP) and y (parameters).
    2) sensitivity_plots_16thApril.ipynb performs sensitivity analysis using the data simulated 
       (using DCM_for_JR_all_varied_11_May.ipynb) with a linear method where all parameters are simulated independently.
    3) deeplearning_all_noise.ipynb applies a bi-LSTM model to infer the simulated data's y (Jansen Rit Model parameters).

# Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

    1) Dataset Simulation:
        Run DCM_for_JR_all_varied_11_May.ipynb to generate the datasets.

        
    2) Sensitivity Analysis:
        Use sensitivity_plots_16thApril.ipynb to analyze the parameters' sensitivity. This notebook utilizes datasets generated with specific parameter settings, method='linear', N= 200.
        
        Hereâ€™s an example of how you might simulate data for sensitivity analysis:

   
        # Define the parameter ranges and other variables
        parameter_ranges = {'A1': (2.6, 9.75)}
        N = 200
        method = 'linear'
        
       #Call the simulation function
        simulate_for_parameter(parameter_ranges, L, Ii, Ip, p, dt, C, transient_duration, 
                               info, src, events, ground_truth=ground_truth, 
                               method=method, N=N, noise=noise, noise_cov=noise_cov, 
                               base_path=base_path)




        
    3)  Deep Learning Analysis:
        Execute deeplearning_all_noise.ipynb to apply the bi-LSTM model. Use generated files to load in the jupyter notebook.
